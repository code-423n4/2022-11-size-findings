#### State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage

The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replace each Gwarmaccess (100 gas) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

        if (a.params.merkleRoot != bytes32(0)) {
            bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender));
            if (!MerkleProofLib.verify(proof, a.params.merkleRoot, leaf)) {
                revert InvalidProof();
            }
        }
```


#### `finalize()` loop can be break instead of continue

If the function work as expected, there is no need to proceed with the loop, since all the later iterations are useless:

            // Only fill if above reserve price
            if (quotePerBase < data.reserveQuotePerBase) continue;

            // Auction has been fully filled
            if (data.filledBase == data.totalBaseAmount) continue;
```


#### Use bit shift instead of power operation

`x / 256` is the same as `x >> 8`. While the compiler uses the SHR opcode to accomplish both, the version that uses division incurs an overhead of 20 gas due to JUMPs to and from a compiler utility function that introduces checks which can be avoided by using unchecked {} around the division by 256.
