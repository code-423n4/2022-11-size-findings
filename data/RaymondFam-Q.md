## Use `delete` to Clear Variables
`delete a` assigns the initial value for the type to `a`. i.e. for integers it is equivalent to `a = 0`, but it can also be used on arrays, where it assigns a dynamic array of length zero or a static array of the same length with all elements reset. For structs, it assigns a struct with all members reset. Similarly, it can also be used to set an address to zero address. It has no effect on whole mappings though (as the keys of mappings may be arbitrary and are generally unknown). However, individual keys and what they map to can be deleted: If `a` is a mapping, then `delete a[x]` will delete the value stored at x.

The delete key better conveys the intention and is also more idiomatic. Consider replacing assignments of zero with delete statements. Here are some the three instances entailed:

## `block.timestamp` Unreliable
The use of `block.timestamp` as part of the time checks can be slightly altered by miners/validators to favor them in contracts that have logic strongly dependent on them.

Consider taking into account this issue and warning the users that such a scenario could happen. If the alteration of timestamps cannot affect the protocol in any way, consider documenting the reasoning and writing tests enforcing that these guarantees will be preserved even if the code changes in the future.

## Function Calls in Loop Could Lead to Denial of Service
Function calls made in unbounded loop are error-prone with potential resource exhaustion as it can trap the contract due to the gas limitations or failed transactions. Here are some of the instances entailed:

## Last Array Element Omitted
The following instance of for loop is going to have the last element of the array omitted.

Consider refactoring the code line as follows:

```
        for (uint256 i; i < seenBidMap.length; i++) {
```
The following refactoring of code is another alternative albeit less gas efficient though because of the adoption of `<=` instead of `<`:

```
        for (uint256 i; i <= seenBidMap.length; i++) {
```
## Variable Names
Consider making the naming of local variables more verbose and descriptive so all other peer developers would better be able to comprehend the intended statement logic, significantly enhancing the code readability. Here are some of the instances entailed:

## Un-indexed Parameters in Events
Consider indexing parameters for events, serving as logs filter when looking for specifically wanted data. Up to three parameters in an event function can receive the attribute `indexed` which will cause the respective arguments to be treated as log topics instead of data.

## Inadequate NatSpec
Solidity contracts can use a special form of comments, i.e., the Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format (NatSpec) to provide rich documentation for functions, return variables and more. Please visit the following link for further details:
