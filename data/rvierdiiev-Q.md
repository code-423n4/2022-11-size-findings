### 1. Auction can be created without public key.
SizeSealed.createAuction [do not check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-size/blob/main/src/SizeSealed.sol#L55-L110) if public key was provided by seller. 

If it was not provided that means that users canâ€™t bid on it as they do not know public key that should be used for encryption.

### 2. Do not allow users to bid if they provide different public key than auction.params.pubKey
When seller creates auction, then he provides `auction.params.pubKey` param. This public key should be used by all bidders.

Function `bid` also has input param `pubKey` which means the public key that was used to sign bid.
If `pubKey != auction.params.pubKey` the function should revert as this means that this bid will never be executed.
