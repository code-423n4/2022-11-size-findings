## Anbody can finalize an auction under certain conditions

If a seller reveals its auction but does not finalize it by calling `reveal()`  with empty `finalizeData`, the `finalize()` function will not be called. Anybody can then finalize the auction by calling `finalize()` with correct parameters. It's weird although the auction result cannot be manipulated.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add a `require(msg.sender == a.data.seller)` statement in the `finalize()` function after Line221 of file `SizeSealed.sol`.
