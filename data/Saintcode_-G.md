## USE CALLDATA INSTEAD OF MEMORY

When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution.

When arguments are read-only on external functions, the data location should be `calldata`

## <ARRAY>.LENGTH SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED UP IN EVERY LOOP OF A FOR-LOOP

Reading array length at each iteration of the loop consumes more gas than necessary.
In the best case scenario (length read on a memory variable), caching the array length in the stack saves around 3 gas per iteration. In the worst case scenario (external calls at each iteration), the amount of gas wasted can be massive.

Consider storing the arrayâ€™s length in a variable before the for-loop, and use this new variable instead

## <X> += <Y> COSTS MORE GAS THAN <X> = <X> + <Y> FOR STATE VARIABLES

## `++I` INSTEAD OF `I++` (OR USE ASSEMBLY WHEN APPLICABLE)

Use `++i` instead of ` i++`. This is especially useful in for loops but this optimization can be used anywhere in your code.

## `++I/I++` SHOULD BE `UNCHECKED{++I}`/`UNCHECKED{I++}` WHEN IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO OVERFLOW, AS IS THE CASE WHEN USED IN FOR- AND WHILE-LOOPS

The unchecked keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves 30-40 gas per loop
`
   for (uint256 i = 0; i < orders.length; /** NOTE: Removed i++ **/ ) {
           // Do the thing
           // Unchecked pre-increment is cheapest
           unchecked { ++i; }   
}  `
