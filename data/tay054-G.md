 USING PRIVATE RATHER THAN PUBLIC FOR CONSTANTS, SAVES GAS

If needed, the value can be read from the verified contract source code. Savings are due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

this saves 6 gas per loop
