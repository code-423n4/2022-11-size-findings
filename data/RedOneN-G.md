## [G-01] ++i/i++ should be UNCHECKED{++i}/UNCHECKED{i++} when it is not possible for them to overflow (eg. in for and while loops).

The unchecked keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves around 40 gas per loop.

## [G-02] Usage of UINT/INT smaller than 256bits incurs overhead.

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

## [G-03] Non-strict inequalities are cheaper than strict ones.

Strict inequalities (>) are more expensive than non-strict ones (>=). This is due to some supplementary checks (ISZERO, 3 gas). This also holds true between <= and <.

## [G-04] "Indexing" variables inside an Event (up to 3 indexes) saves GAS.
